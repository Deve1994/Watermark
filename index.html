            Removing watermarks from the InShot app APK or any other app without proper licensing or permission is against the app's terms of service and could be considered a violation of copyright law. 
            However, there are legitimate ways to use InShot without watermarks:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Upgrade to InShot Pro:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Purchase the Pro version of InShot to unlock all features, including watermark removal. 
                    It's a one-time payment or subscription, depending on your region, and supports the app's developers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use InShot's Free Watermark Removal Option:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Some versions of InShot allow you to remove the watermark for free by watching a short advertisement. 
                    Check for this option while exporting your video.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Edit the Watermark Out:</strong> 
                <p>
                    If the watermark is in a non-intrusive location, you can crop it out using a video editor. 
                    However, this may affect your video's framing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Look for Promotional Offers:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Occasionally, InShot offers free Pro subscriptions during promotions. 
                    Keep an eye on their social media channels or official announcements.
